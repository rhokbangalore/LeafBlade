Problem:safe spaces where kids can go and ask questions about sex education are non existent.

Solution :The team came up with the idea where the users could anonymously have conversations with the qualified doctors in private and no history of the conversation is saved. They could also ask specific questions to the list of available doctors. They used Mongo DB as their database. The demo was not completed, some more integration is required. A feedback mechanism is yet to be integrated.
